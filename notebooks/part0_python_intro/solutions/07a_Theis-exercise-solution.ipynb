    "# 07: Using functions to solve an equation-- The Theis example\n",
    "In this exercise we will implement the Theis equation in Python using functions, to evaluate drawdown in hydraulic head from pumping at a well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The Theis (1935) equation is used to calculate drawdown for two-dimensional radial groundwater flow to a point source in an infinite, homogeneous aquifer. The Theis equation was derived from heat transfer literature (with the mathematical help of C.I. Lubin) and is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "s = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi T} W(u)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "$s$ is drawdown [L],  \n",
    "$Q$ is the pumping rate [L$^3$/T],  \n",
    "$T$ is the aquifer transmissivity [L$^2$/T],  \n",
    "$u$ is a dimensionless time parameter [unitless], and  \n",
    "$W(u)$ is the Well function (exponential integral $E_1$) [unitless]. The exponential integral is available in ``scipy.special`` as the ``exp1()`` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensionless time parameter is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "u = \\frac{r^2S}{4Tt}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "$r$ is the distance from the pumping well to a point where drawdown is observed [L],   \n",
    "$S$ is storativity [unitless], and  \n",
    "$t$ is the time since pumping began. \n",
    "\n",
    "Storativity is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "S = S_s b\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "$S_s$ is specific storage [1/L] and   \n",
    "$b$ is the thickness of the aquifer."
