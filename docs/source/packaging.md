# Packaging: the next level

* Is your hard drive littered with miscellaneous scripts and
Jupyter Notebooks that do similar things?
* Are you copying and pasting the same code repeatedly?
* Are you struggling to keep track of different versions of that
code, or where you made the last change?
* Are you sharing code over email or chat?

**If you answered yes to a few of these, you may need a package!**

With a package we can:
* Collaborate on code in one place
* Share, install and import any version into any script
* Have confidence with automated tests; even as things change
* Create and share nice looking documentation

Making a package needn’t be difficult, nor does it
require “finished” code or formal publication. You can write
packages for yourself or your internal colleagues! With
cookiecutter templates, you can be up and running with a single
code file in minutes and develop the package as you work on
your project!
