    "# 08b: Modflow-setup local grid refinement (LGR) demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "[Modflow-setup](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/modflow-setup) is a Python package for automating construction of MODFLOW  models from grid-independent source data including shapefiles, rasters, and other MODFLOW models that are geo-located. Input data and model construction options are summarized in a single configuration file in the [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format. Source data are read from their native formats and mapped to a regular finite difference grid specified in the configuration file. An external array-based Flopy model instance with the desired packages is created from the sampled source data and configuration settings. Since every modeling problem is different, the Flopy model instance can be further modified in the same script, using Flopy or other Python packages. MODFLOW input can then be written from the flopy model instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example problem\n",
    "Here we demonstrate Modflow-setup with a simplified version of the Pleasant Lake model published by Fienen et al (2022), who used a multi-scale modeling approach to evaluate the effects of agricultural groundwater abstraction on the ecology of Pleasant Lake in central Wisconsin, USA. The original report and model files are available at the links below. Figure 1 shows the original published model, which included a coarse (200 meter resolution) \"parent\" model tightly coupled to a 20 meter resolution local grid refinement (LGR) inset (sub)model (see for example, Mehl and others, 2006; Langevin and others, 2017). The parent model was designed to capture the transient effects of agricultural pumping; the inset model was created to simulate groundwater/lake interactions at a finer scale. To incorporate the effects of distant boundaries, the parent model was in turn loosely coupled to a larger transient regional model via specified head boundaries along the model parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some advantages of this multi-scale approach over an unstructured grid alternative include:\n",
    "* The large regional model, which consumes substantial disk space and carries a longer run time, can be managed independently of the parent and inset models. The perimeter of the parent model is sufficiently distant from the area of interest where two-way coupling is not needed.\n",
    "* Uniform, rectilinear grids are used for the parent and inset models, which greatly simplifies model construction, diagnostics, postprocessing and visualization\n",
    "* With the parent and inset models tightly coupled at the matrix (inner iteration) level, little or no model solution efficiency is lost vs. an unstructured discretization approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages\n",
    "* Two models must be managed, which nearly doubles the number of files for the project\n",
    "* Any code for visualizing the whole model must iterate through the models in the simulation; additional complexity is often needed to stitch the two models together, for example in making the seamless water table contours here. This also makes it harder to re-use code between the LGR simulation and other single-model simulations.\n",
    "* Particles and mass transport can't be simulated across the boundary between the parent model and local grid refinement area.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/doi-usgs/modflow-setup/blob/develop/docs/source/_static/fig1_pleasant_lake_model.jpg?raw=true\" align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1**: The full Pleasant Lake model domain with location map, showing the relationship between the regional, parent and LGR inset models, as well as the irrigation wells considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most details of the Fienen et al (2022) model are included here, but to reduce file sizes and execution time, a smaller parent model domain is used, and the inset model spacing is increased to 40 meters. The example model here is for illustrative purposes only, and is not intended to be adequate for representing pumping impacts or providing a sufficient distance to the perimeter boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example model details  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Transient MODFLOW-6 simulation with local grid refinement (LGR)\n",
    "* \"Parent\" and LGR \"inset\" models are dynamically coupled via the Groundwater Flow Exchange Package at the MODFLOW 6 Simulation level\n",
    "* Coarser \"parent\" model grid has a uniform 200 meter cell size \n",
    "* Locally refined \"inset\" model grid has a uniform 40 meter cell size\n",
    "* Both parent and inset models are 5 layers\n",
    "* Parent model is in turn based partially on a larger regional MODFLOW 6 model\n",
    "    * The RCHa, NPF, STO, and WEL input are rediscretized from the regional model\n",
    "    * Layer 1 in the regional model is represented by layers 1 and 2 in the parent and inset models\n",
    "    * The remaining layers are mapped as follows: regional layer 2 to parent/inset layer 3, 3:4 and 4:5\n",
    "* All models begin with an initial steady-state stress period, followed by monthly timesteps representing calendar year 2012.\n",
    "* Starting heads for the parent and inset models are resampled from the regional model binary output.\n",
    "* The Streamflow Routing (SFR) packages in the parent and inset models are constructed from a [NHDPlus v2 dataset](https://nhdplus.com/NHDPlus/NHDPlusV2_data.php), and linked together using the Water Mover (MVR) Package\n",
    "* Head observations are specified from csv files\n",
    "* LGR inset model extent is based on a buffer distance around a feature of interest (the lake).\n",
    "* LGR inset model DIS, IC, NPF, STO and RCHa input are rediscretized from the parent model input.\n",
    "* The Lake package is created from a polygon feature, bathymetry raster, stage-area-volume file and climate data from [PRISM](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/).\n",
    "* Lake package observations are set up automatically (with an output file for each lake)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we'll see below, Modflow-setup does all of this automatically, based on input specified in two configuration files(for the parent and inset models) that can be viewed with VSCode or any YAML-aware text editor.\n",
