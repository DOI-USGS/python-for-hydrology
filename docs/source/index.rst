==================================
USGS Python for Hydrology Course
==================================

Welcome to the USGS python for hydrology and flopy course. This is organized into two parts: part 0 focusing on general python for data analysis in hydrologic contexts, and part 1 focusing on flopy - the python interface into MODFLOW for groundwater modeling.

We encourage students to explore these materials for their own study or to reach out to USGS to attend an in-person course.
